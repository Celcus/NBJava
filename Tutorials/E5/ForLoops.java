     * how a FOR loop works:
     * 1. Instantiate the loop's variable (it is usually an INT or a DOUBLE)

     * 3. Increment/Decrement that loop variable by X amount
     * 4. Perform the code statements within the loop
     * 5. re-check step 2, if True, do step 3, then perform code within the loop
